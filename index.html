  <p>Welcome to the Collaborative Robotics Lab (Collab) at Virginia Tech!
  We create learning and control algorithms for robots that collaborate with people.
  Our goal is to develop intelligent robots that understand &mdash; and are understood by &mdash; their human partners.
  These robots personalize their behavior: continually adapting to what the human wants and proactively helping them to achieve their goals.
  Overall, our research explores the intersection of human-robot interaction, machine learning, control theory, and cognitive science,
  with applications in personal, interactive, and assistive robots.</p>
