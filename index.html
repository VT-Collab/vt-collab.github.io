  <p>Welcome to the Collaborative Robotics Lab at Virginia Tech!
  We create learning and control algorithms for robots that collaborate with people.
  Our goal is to develop intelligent robots that understand --- and are understood by --- their human partners.
  These robots personalize their behavior: continually adapting to what the human wants and proactively helping them to achieve their goals.
  Overall, our research explores the intersection of human-robot interaction, machine learning, control theory, and cognitive science,
  with applications in personal, interactive, and assistive robots.</p>
