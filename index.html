Welcome to the Collaborative Robotics Lab at Virginia Tech!
Our goal is to create robots that work alongside people to perform everyday tasks.
We develop learning algorithms for human-robot interaction: enabling robots to
intelligently model and proactively influence their partner's behavior.
Our research explores the intersection of machine learning, control theory, and cognitive science,
with applications in personalized and assistive robots.
