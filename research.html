Our group explores the foundations of human-robot interaction.
Our goal is to enable robots to seamlessly and intelligently interact with human partners.
We seek out problems inspired by the challenges of everyday users &mdash;
particularly for people who could benefit from assistance &mdash;
as well as problems motivated by future applications &mdash; such as personal robots or robots in the home.
Our projects typically involve three steps:
<ol>
  <li>Formalizing the problem within a larger context</li>
  <li>Creating an analytical solution</li>
  <li>Testing our approach with real people and robots</li>
</ol>
We believe that effective research balances theory and practice.
We strive to fundamentally understand how humans and robot should interact,
while also conducting user studies to determine what people really need.
