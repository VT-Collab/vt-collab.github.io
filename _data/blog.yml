  note: "It's hard for robots to seamlessly interact when humans change their behavior. We explore how robots can co-adapt alongside other agents by capturing their behavior as a high-level strategy, and then influencing that strategy over repeated interactions."

- title: 'When Humans Aren’t Optimal: Robots that Collaborate with Risk-Aware Humans'
  authors: Minae and Dylan

  note: "To create human-like robots, we need to understand how humans behave. We present a modeling approach which enables robots to anticipate that humans can make suboptimal choices when risk and uncertainty are involved."

- title: 'Controlling Assistive Robots with Learned Latent Actions'
  authors: Dylan

  note: "We want to make it easier for humans to teleoperate dexterous robots. We present a learning approach that embeds high-dimensional robot actions into an intuitive, human-controllable, and low-dimensional latent space."

- title: 'Learning from My Partner’s Actions: Roles in Decentralized Robot Teams'
  authors: Dylan

  note: "When groups robots work together, their actions communicate valuable information. We introduce a collaborative learning and control strategy that enables robots to harness the information contained within their partner's actions."

- title: 'Learning Robot Objectives from Physical Human Interaction'
  authors: Andrea

  note: "Physical interactions are often intentional, purposeful corrections. We present an optimal approach for learning from these corrections, so that robots understand what we really want them to do."
